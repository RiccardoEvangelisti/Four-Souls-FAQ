# Variants

### Two-Player Mini-Draft

It is recommended, if you play a competitive game with two players (i.e. 1v1), that you start the game with a ‘mini-draft’ of items.

Setup the game as normal, then lay out the top 3 cards of the treasure deck. The first player gains one of the items, then the other player gains one of the remaining items. Put the last card on the bottom of the treasure deck. Repeat this process, alternating who picks first, until both players have 2 items in addition to their starting item, then play as normal.

You can also play the mini-draft variant with more players if you fancy a game with a quicker start! Simply increase the number of treasure cards laid out (to one more than the number of players – e.g. if playing with 4 players you would lay out 5 cards each time). For the first item, Player 1 (the player who has been selected to have the first turn) picks first, followed by each other player in turn order. For the second item, the player who just picked last picks first, followed by each other player in reverse turn order.

### Eden Only

In this variant, rather than being dealt a random character card at the start of the game, each player is dealt an Eden. If you have less Eden cards than players, you can use any other character card as a stand-in.
