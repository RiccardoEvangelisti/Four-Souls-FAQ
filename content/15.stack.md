The Stack
---------

Loot, abilities, and rolls don’t affect the game right away. Instead, they are put onto a waiting area called **the stack**. **The stack** is an important concept that determines the order of effects and allows players to react to each other and to the game.

**The stack** is a zone where loot, abilities, dice rolls, and other things go to **resolve. Resolving** means that the thing on the stack leaves the stack and its effect is carried out by the player or players instructed to do so.

Each thing added to the stack is added to the top. This means the stack **resolves from the top down**, i.e. in a **last in, first out** order. That means that things on the stack will resolve in the reverse of the order they were added to it.

A loot or ability **resolves** when each player passes **priority** in succession from the player who put that loot or ability on the stack, with that player also not putting anything else on the stack themselves (i.e. no one is able to/wants to respond with anything else, see **Priority**). Priority passes each time something resolves. This means that players can add new things to **the stack** as things leave it, i.e. everything on the stack does not need to resolve in one go. However, any individual thing cannot be interrupted while it is resolving.

If the stack is empty when all players pass priority, the game progresses to the next step or phase of the turn as appropriate. A player’s **action phase** is an exception to this: the game will only move to the **end phase** when the active player decides to end their turn, or an ability ends the turn.

The stack may seem complicated at first, but it is actually fairly intuitive and should become much clearer when you start playing the game. It can be helpful to think of the stack as an actual physical pile of cards. As things are added to it, you pile the ‘cards’ on top of each other. When things start resolving and leaving the stack, to find out what happens next, you take the top card of the stack and do what it says. Each time you take something off, players have a chance to put more cards on. This continues until the pile is empty and nobody wants to play any more cards.

![Diagram demonstrating the stack. On the bottom of a pile of cards is The Relic. Above that is the card Sleight of Hand, and above that is a Butter Bean. The diagram has a piece of text at the bottom, next to The Relic, saying "First played, last to resolve". There is a piece of text at the top next to the Butter Bean saying "Last played, first to resolve".](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Stack-Example-1024x755.png)

Player 1 had The Relic trigger. In response, Player 2 tried to use Sleight of Hand to put a bad card on top, but Player 1 played Butter Bean on the Sleight of Hand. They resolve in reverse: Butter Bean cancels Sleight of Hand’s ability, then Player 1 loots from The Relic.

Targets of abilities are chosen when they are put onto the stack, rather than at resolution. If the target is no longer valid by the time that ability resolves, it will simply fizzle (have no effect). Similarly, if an ability says ‘choose one-’, you choose one of the options (indicated with a • symbol) when the ability is put onto the stack, rather than at resolution. A player would not be able to pick a certain option and then change their mind later on.

If an ability is removed from the stack, it does not resolve. If a loot being played is removed from the stack by an ability, it does not resolve and is moved to whatever zone is determined by the ability. If a loot or ability is **cancelled,** then it is removed from the stack without resolving. Loot cards removed from the stack in this way go to the loot discard.
