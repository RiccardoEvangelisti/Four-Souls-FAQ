Game Zones
----------

**Game Zones** are areas of the game where cards and objects exist. Some cards and objects may have certain properties or characteristics that depend on which game zone they are in.

If a card moves from one game zone to another at any point it is considered a new object. Any abilities that would have targeted it before it moved game zone will fizzle as they would no longer be able to find it.

### In Play

**In play** is an important zone, and is made up of the play area between all players. In play includes all objects a player controls (such as characters, items, and souls), and the topmost object in any shop, monster, or room slots. In play is a public zone, and all objects within it are considered public information, unless otherwise specified.

Part of the reason in play is an important zone is that abilities that check for or target objects only check for or target objects that are in play, unless otherwise specified.

When an object enters play, it is considered a separate entity from anything that it may have been previously related to. For example, if a monster is covered and leaves play, then is later uncovered, it isn’t considered the same monster from before it was covered.

### Decks

There are four deck zones in Four Souls, each corresponding to one of four card types: Treasure, Loot, Monster, and Room. Each deck can only contain cards of the corresponding type. For example, the treasure deck can only contain treasure cards. Some cards, such as the bonus souls, don’t have a deck, and those cards therefore can’t be put into any deck. Some cards, such as The Harbingers/The Beast, start outside the game. An object that was originally outside of the game, as long as it corresponds to a certain card type, can go into the appropriate deck.

The decks are a hidden zone, and cards in decks are considered hidden information. This means they can’t be viewed unless an effect or ability instructs a player to do so. Similarly, the order of cards in a deck can’t be changed, unless a player is instructed to by an ability.

In the unlikely event that a deck ever runs out of cards, you immediately shuffle the appropriate discard pile and make that the new deck.

### Discard

The game also has four discard zones – one that corresponds to each deck. Similar to the decks, cards that don’t correspond to a certain discard can’t be put into that discard. For example, a loot card can’t be put into the monster discard, even if that loot card is a monster while it is in play.

If a player is instructed to put a card or object into discard, it is put into the appropriate discard. A card put into discard is put on top of that discard. If that card or object doesn’t have a discard, it is instead removed from the game. Similarly to with the decks, as long as an object that was originally outside the game does correspond to a card type it can be put into the appropriate discard.

The discards are a public zone, and as such all cards in discard are considered public information, unless otherwise specified. The number of cards in discard is also public information.

The order of cards in discard can’t be changed unless a player is instructed to do so by an ability.

### Hand

Each player has their own hand zone. The hand only ever consists of loot cards. A player’s hand is a hidden zone, and cards in a player’s hand are only viewable by that player, unless otherwise specified. The number of cards in a player’s hand is public information, however.

If a player is instructed to discard a loot card, a loot card of their choice from their hand is moved into the loot discard. If a player is instructed to gain a loot card, it is moved from its previous zone into that player’s hand. As the hand only ever consists of loot cards, if a player is instructed to move a non-loot card into their hand, nothing happens.

### Covered in a Slot

There are numerous situations that might result in a card in a slot being covered by another card. This most commonly happens with monster slots. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be covered in any one slot. Being covered in a slot is considered a different game zone, and importantly cards that are covered in a slot aren’t considered in play.

When an object that is covering a card in a slot leaves play, the card that is under it enters play and is no longer covered in a slot. Ambushes and Trinkets that are covered in a slot become monsters and items again respectively when they enter play from being uncovered.

Covered in a slot is a public zone. That means all cards covered in a slot are considered public information, unless otherwise specified. The order of cards in a slot can’t be changed unless a player is instructed to do so by an ability.

### The Stack

**The stack** is a zone where loot, abilities, dice rolls, and other things go to **resolve. Resolving** means that the thing on the stack leaves the stack and its effect is carried out by the player or players instructed to do so (see **The Stack**).

The stack is an important concept that determines the order of effects and allows players to react to each other and to the game.

Each new loot, ability, or dice roll is added to the top of the stack. The stack resolves in a last in, first out order. That means that the last thing put onto the stack will resolve before things put onto the stack before it

A loot or ability resolves when each player passes **priority** in succession from the player who put that loot or ability on the stack, with that player also not putting anything on else the stack themselves (see **Priority**).

If an ability is removed from the stack, it does not resolve. If a loot being played is removed from the stack by an ability, it does not resolve and is moved to whatever zone is determined by the ability. If a loot or ability is **canceled,** then it is removed from the stack without resolving. Loot cards removed from the stack in this way go to the loot discard.

### Outside the Game

**Outside the game** is a zone that consists of cards that aren’t in any of the previously listed zones.

The **active bonus souls** that have been chosen for the game start outside the game, as does the card “The Harbingers” from the Requiem expansion. Character cards, starting item cards, and bonus souls that aren’t being used also exist outside the game.

Unless otherwise specified, cards that are outside the game don’t have abilities. The three **active bonus souls** are an exception to this, and their abilities are active while they are outside the game.

If you don’t own a card, aren’t playing with a card that would exist outside the game, or no copies of that card are outside the game, then you can’t get that card from outside the game if you are instructed to.

If a player is instructed to remove an object or card from the game, the object or card is moved outside the game.

If a player is instructed to put an object or card under an object not in a slot, it is considered outside the game. For example, Friendly Ball’s ability puts monsters under it. The cards that are under it are outside the game.

Cards that are outside the game are considered public information, unless otherwise specified. Face-down cards outside the game are considered hidden information. Effects and abilities may give you permission to look at these cards, however.
