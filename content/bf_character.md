While in play, character cards are objects referred to as **characters**. (*thus, thay are not items*)

A character card may list a **starting item**. This is a triggered ability that functions when the card enters play and causes the player that controls that character to put that starting item card under their control. These triggered abilities don’t use the stack.

Starting item cards and Character cards start outside the game.

While in play, starting item cards are objects referred to as **items**. Starting items have the keyword ability **Eternal** (which means they can’t be destroyed or put into discard).

Character cards have a stat box with a health stat and an attack stat. These define the stats of the player that controls that character.

A character may be worth souls if it has a soul icon on it, or if there is a soul value specified by an effect. For example, The Lost provides a soul value of 1. Characters that have a soul value are **not** considered a soul.
