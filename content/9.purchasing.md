Purchasing
----------

The active player can declare a purchase during their action phase whilst the stack is empty. That means a player couldn’t make a purchase during an attack, or while their death is on the stack, for example.

When a player declares a purchase, before they choose what to purchase, priority passes. Players can then choose to purchase a shop item in a shop slot, or the top card of the treasure deck. Abilities can be triggered by or otherwise interact with purchase declarations, either before or after a target is chosen, just the same as attack declarations.

At this point, the cost of what is being purchased is determined. By default, it costs 10¢ to purchase either a shop item or the top of the treasure deck. If a player can’t pay the cost at this point, purchasing ends and they fail to purchase an item. If they are able to pay the cost, they gain control of whatever it was they chose to purchase.

By default, the active player may purchase once per turn. Effects and abilities may modify the number of purchases the active player can make.
