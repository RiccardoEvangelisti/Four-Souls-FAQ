# Card Types


### Treasure Cards

![Image](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TreasureCardBack-751x1024.png#93x128)

Treasure cards are found in the treasure deck. Whilst **in play** (see **Game Zones**), a treasure card is an object referred to as an **item**. This means `items are either controlled by a player or in the shop.`

Players will acquire items throughout the game. Items have a wide variety of abilities that can range from modifying gameplay to interacting with other players and monsters (see **Abilities**). Players place any items they control face up in front of them.

Any time a card instructs a player to **gain treasure**, they gain that many cards from the top of the treasure deck, putting them into play under their control.

A player’s **starting item** is considered an **item**. Starting items intrinsically have the starting item quality.

#### Item Borders

Treasure cards can have either a gold or a silver border. The border color itself has no mechanical meaning, but serves as a reminder of what kind of abilities the card has: a gold-bordered card (an **active item**) has one or more activated abilities, while a silver-bordered card doesn’t have any activated abilities (a **passive item**).

#### Shop Items

Items in the shop slots are referred to as **shop items**. Shop items can be purchased (see **Purchasing**). Unless otherwise specified, an item’s abilities do not function while it is in the shop, with the exception of triggered abilities that trigger when an item enters or leaves play.

### Loot Cards

Loot cards are found in the loot deck, and in players’ hands. When a player is instructed to **loot**, they draw that many cards from the top of the loot deck into their hand. Players keep loot cards in their hand until they **play** or **discard** them. A player’s hand is private, but anyone can count the number of cards in a player’s hand.

Players can **play** loot cards from their hand whenever they have **priority** (see **The Stack**) and a **loot play** available (see **Turn Structure**). When loot cards are played they are put onto **the stack** and referred to as **loot**. When a **loot** resolves, you perform its **loot ability** (see **Abilities**), and then put it into the loot discard.

Some abilities and effects may permit a player to play loot cards from other zones. In these cases normal timing and loot play rules still apply, unless otherwise specified. Some other abilities instead allow players to play loot cards as part of resolution. In these cases timing rules do not apply, unless otherwise specified, but loot play rules do still apply. There are also some abilities that will permit a player to play a loot card without using a loot play. This will be specified in the ability if it is the case.

### Monster Cards

Monster cards are found in the monster deck. Whilst **in play**, monster cards are objects referred to as either a **monster** (if they have a stat block) or an **event** (if they don’t have a stat block).

If an ability on a monster card doesn’t specify a particular player, instead referring to ‘you’, it means the active player.

Abilities on monster cards only function while in play, unless otherwise specified. Abilities on monster cards don’t function while they are a soul, unless otherwise specified.

#### **Monsters**

Non-event monster cards that have a stat block become **monsters** when in play, and exist in **monster slots**.

**Monsters** can be attacked, unless otherwise specified (see **Attacking**).  
When a monster is killed, it yields a reward, as indicated in the reward box on the card. The **active player** (the player whose turn it is) always receives the rewards when a monster dies, regardless of who actually killed it. The same is true for any souls that may be gained when a **boss** dies.

**Boss cards** are a type of non-event monster card that have a soul icon. They tend to be harder to kill than other monsters, but tend to yield greater rewards, as well as **souls**! When a monster with a soul icon dies, the active player gains it as a **soul**, unless otherwise specified.

#### **Events**

Event cards are a type of monster card that have no stat block. They become **events** when in play, and also exist in **monster slots**, but they can’t be attacked.

All abilities on event cards, unless otherwise specified, are triggered abilities (see **Abilities**) that trigger **when the card enters play**. If an event card has multiple abilities they will all trigger when the event enters play, unless otherwise specified.

When each of an event’s abilities have resolved or been canceled it is put into the monster discard.

If an event leaves play, its abilities are removed from the stack.  
**Curse cards** are a type of event card, with the keyword ability **curse** (see **Keyworded Abilities**). The active player chooses which player receives any revealed curses, and they are placed face up near that player’s character. When a player dies, they put all curses they control into discard.

### Souls

A number of cards of different types have a soul icon. When a player controls a card with a soul icon as a **soul**, it provides them with a soul value. The soul value a soul provides is normally indicated by the icon on the card, but can also be indicated by an effect that specifies a value. Souls are quite important – when a player controls a total soul value of 4, they win! Players keep any souls they control face up next to their character to keep track of them. The number of souls a player controls is public information.

There are a number of different ways a player can gain a card with a soul icon as an object called a **soul**. If the card has a reward box, the active player (unless otherwise specified) gains it as a soul when it dies or is destroyed. Otherwise it is likely an ability on the card will specify what conditions need to be met, or what otherwise needs to happen, before it can be gained as a soul.

Even if a **soul** has a soul value greater than 1 it is still considered a single object. This means a soul with a soul value of 2 can be destroyed or stolen, for example, just the same as any other soul with a soul value of 1.

There are, however, a number of abilities in the game that look for the number of souls a player controls. These abilities refer to the **total soul value** a player controls.

Similarly, if an ability looks for a player gaining or being given a soul, it will consider a soul with a soul value of greater than 1 the same as gaining or being given a number of souls equal to that soul value, even though technically just one soul is coming under that player’s control.

#### Bonus Souls

Once you are more familiar with the game’s mechanics, you are encouraged to add **bonus souls** to your games.

When starting a game where you are playing with bonus souls, you shuffle them and pick 3 at random. Those 3 are the **active bonus souls** for the game. These cards are not added to any deck and are instead put face up next to the play area. Bonus souls, before they are gained, are not considered in play.

Once the conditions of a bonus soul are met it is gained and becomes a **soul**. This happens as soon as the conditions are met. From this point, it will act like any other soul under the control of a player. Abilities on bonus souls don’t function once they have been gained as a **soul**, unless otherwise specified.

Bonus souls can only be gained once per game. If a bonus soul is ever destroyed, they are placed face down next to the game and cannot be gained again.

### Character Cards

Character cards start outside the game. When starting the game, a character card is randomly assigned to a player and put into play under their control (see **Setup**). While in play, character cards are objects referred to as **characters**.

A character card may list a **starting item**. This is a triggered ability that functions when the card enters play and causes the player that controls that character to put that starting item card under their control. Starting item cards also start outside the game. These triggered abilities don’t use the stack. While in play, starting item cards are objects referred to as **items**. Starting items have the keyword ability **Eternal** which means they can’t be destroyed or put into discard.

Character cards have a stat box with a health stat and an attack stat. These define the stats of the player that controls that character.

A character may be worth souls if it has a soul icon on it, or if there is a soul value specified by an effect. For example, The Lost provides a soul value of 1. Characters that have a soul value are **not** considered a soul.

### Room Cards

![Image](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RoomCardBack-1024x751.png#93x128)

Room cards were introduced in the Requiem expansion. Room cards are found in the room deck, which is an optional bonus deck that can be added once you feel comfortable with the basic rules of the game. While **in play**, room cards are objects referred to as **rooms**. Rooms exist in **room slots**.

Rooms can have different types of abilities through which they influence the game. Static and triggered abilities on rooms work just the same as anywhere else. Activated abilities on rooms can only be activated by the active player. If a room’s ability doesn’t specify a particular player, for example instead referring to ‘you’, it means the active player.

During the **end phase** (see **Turn Structure**), if a monster died during the turn, the active player can choose to put a room into discard. If that room slot is empty following this, it will be filled with the top card of the room deck. The active player can of course instead choose to leave any existing rooms in play, if they wish!

### Anatomy of a Card

#### **Name Box**

Contains a card’s name.

#### **Text Box**

Contains effect text, gray text, ability tags, and dividing lines.

*   **Effect text** details any abilities of a card.
*   **Gray text** serves as either flavor text or as a reminder of how a certain keyword or mechanic works, but has no mechanical meaning itself.
*   **Ability tags** are used to denote the type of any activated abilities on the card (e.g. ↷ or $). Tags are also used by cards that use **levels** to indicate which abilities a card has at a given level.
*   **Dividing lines** are used to make the layout within a card’s text box more clear. Dark gray lines are used to separate different abilities within the text box of a card and to separate abilities from gray text. Lighter gray lines are used to separate the different potential outcomes for an ability involving a dice roll or an ability where the player is given a choice between a number of options. Each choice in such an ability is also indicated with a bullet point.

#### Stat Box

Contains a card’s stats. There are 3 stats: Health, Evasion, and Attack.

The stat box of a character defines the stats of the player that controls it. Character stat boxes only detail a Health and Attack stat; if an ability allows a player to be attacked by another player, it will specify what their evasion is for that attack.

#### Reward Box

Details the rewards of a card. When an object with a reward box dies or is destroyed, the active player gains any rewards detailed in the reward box, unless otherwise specified.

#### Soul Icon

Some cards have a **soul icon**. This indicates the soul value that the card would provide if gained as a soul by a player.

#### Set Symbol

Cards that are not part of the base game have a symbol here that informs you of the card’s origin (i.e. what set it belongs to).

#### 3+ Player Only Symbol

If a card has the 3+ player only symbol, it means it should be removed when playing the game solo or with only 2 players. If you come across a card with this icon whilst playing solo or with 2 players, simply put it to one side and replace it with another card of the same type.
