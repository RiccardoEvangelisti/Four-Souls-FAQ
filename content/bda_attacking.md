# Attacking

The active player can declare an attack during their action phase whilst the stack is empty.

When a player declares an attack, before they choose what to attack, priority passes. Once priority has passed, that player can then choose to attack a monster in a monster slot, or the top card of the monster deck.

Abilities can be triggered by or otherwise interact with attack declarations. Some abilities are triggered by or interact with the attack declaration itself, before a target is chosen. Others are triggered by or interact with attack declarations against a specific target, and therefore after a target has been chosen. If an ability looks for an attack being declared against a **monster** specifically, it will not be triggered by or interact with an attack declared against the **monster deck**, even if the top card becomes a monster once revealed and placed in a slot. If a card has an ability that is triggered by or interacts with an attack being declared against it (e.g. “When an attack is declared on this”), that ability will trigger or otherwise take effect both if the card is already in play in a slot and if it is revealed as the top card when the monster deck is attacked.

By default, the active player may attack once per turn. Effects and abilities may modify the number of attacks the active player can make. Killing a monster outside of an attack (e.g. with an ability or loot card) does not count as a player making an attack.

If you attack the top card of the monster deck, you reveal it, and then put it on top of a monster slot of your choosing, covering the monster in that slot. Any monsters that are covered are no longer in play. If the card put in the monster slot is an event, its abilities trigger upon entering play, and it is put into discard when they have resolved. If a player attacks the top of the deck and it is a monster that can’t be attacked, they put that monster in a monster slot and cancel the attack. If the card revealed is a card with a stat block, but has an ability that specifies that it can’t be attacked, the attack is canceled.

In some cases, other objects (such as players, items, or rooms) can be attacked. If this is the case, the active player may choose to attack them instead of a monster or the top of the monster deck when they declare an attack.

Each **attack** consists of multiple **attack rolls**. Once an attack has started, the attacking player repeatedly rolls a D6 against their chosen target, most commonly a monster. Once you have started an attack, you are committed to the death! The attack will only end when either the attacking player or the target of the attack dies, or if either the attacker or attacked object has 0HP before an attack roll would be made. Players may use the D8 to keep track of the HP of the monster they are attacking.

Dice rolls that are made as part of an attack are called **attack rolls**. Damage that is done as a result of an attack roll is called **combat damage**. If the result of the attack roll is equal to or higher than the target’s evasion, the attacking player hits and deals **combat damage** equal to their attack to the target (that much combat damage is put on the stack, directed at the target). If the result of the attack roll is less than the target’s evasion, the attacking player misses and **combat damage** equal to the target’s attack is put on the stack, directed at the attacking player (the target deals that much combat damage to the attacking player). Damage is dealt to the appropriate target when this then resolves and leaves the stack. If that damage reduces either the attacking player or attacked object to 0HP, their death is put on the stack. An attack ends when either the player or the target dies, or if either the attacking player or attacked object has 0HP before the next attack roll would be made. An attack can also end by being canceled. This can happen directly by an ability or effect, or through an ability or effect moving the turn to the end phase.

When an attack ends due to a player or monster dying (or an attack being canceled), any unresolved attack rolls and combat damage are removed from **the stack**. This means you could, for example, respond to an attack roll that would miss if it resolved and play a bomb, killing a monster with only 1 HP left before it would kill you. Similarly, however, be wary – another player might respond to your dice roll, that would hit if it resolved, to kill you and end the attack before you can kill the monster, depriving you of your reward!

In some cases, players can be instructed to make attack rolls by an ability even when they aren’t the attacking player. Since they aren’t the attacking player, the attack will not end if they die. Dead players cannot make attack rolls, however, even if they aren’t the attacking player. As normal, the attack ends if the attacking player dies, and therefore no further attack rolls would be made by any player.

In a few rare cases, a player and a monster can take lethal damage at the exact same time. In these cases, the monster’s death would resolve first, followed by the player’s.

The active player always receives the rewards when a monster dies, regardless of who actually killed it. The same is true for any souls that may be gained when a boss dies.

### Attackable Items and Rooms

Normally, attacks are made against monsters. Some other objects, for example items or rooms, can have abilities that allow them to be attacked, however. These cards will have stat blocks detailing their health, evasion, and attack stats for any attacks made against them. While they are in play, players may choose these attackable objects as a target when they declare an attack. All rules on when a player is able to declare an attack still apply. Once the attack has started, it will proceed exactly the same as if the target was a monster (see **Attacking**).

If an attackable object is killed during the attack, it is destroyed (see **Destroy and Kill**). Any rewards, if indicated in a reward box on the card, will go to the active player when that object dies or is destroyed (even if that object is destroyed outside of an attack).

It is important to note that an item or room that can be attacked is not a **monster**. This means they can’t be targeted by any ability or effect that targets a ‘monster’ specifically.

### Attacking Other Players

Some abilities may allow you to attack other players – or indeed allow other players to attack you! These abilities will specify what the targeted player’s evasion will be for the attack. If an ability allows you to attack other players, you may choose a player as a target when you declare an attack. All rules on when you are able to declare an attack still apply. Once the attack has started, it will proceed exactly the same as if the target was a monster (see **Attacking**).

If multiple effects allowing you to attack other players exist at the same time and specify that players have a different evasion stat, the effect that was created most recently takes precedence.
