# Setup
1. Shuffle the Treasure, Loot, Monster, Room Decks. Set aside space for a discard zone next to each of these decks.
2. Fill two **shop slots** with the top two cards of the treasure deck.
3. Fill two **monster slots** with the top two cards of the Monster Deck. Place any event cards on the bottom of the deck and replace them with the top card of the Monster Deck.
4. Fille one **room slot** with the top card of the Room Deck.
5. If you are playing with **bonus souls**, shuffle them, and pick 3 at random. Those 3 are the **active bonus souls** for the game and are placed face-up next to the play area.
6. Deal a random character card (and it's character’s starting item card) to each player. *Characters start the game deactivated, while starting items start the game charged*
7. Abilities that trigger at the start of the game trigger (for example Eden’s triggered ability). No one has priority here and so these abilities will all resolve instantly.
8. Deal 3 loot cards and 3¢ to each player. Each player puts the loot cards in their **hand**.
9. Finally, the saddest player goes first! You can also each roll a dice (lowest roll goes first!).

# Anatomy of a card

#### **Name Box**

Contains a card’s name.

#### **Text Box**

Contains effect text, gray text, ability tags, and dividing lines.

*   **Effect text** details any abilities of a card.
*   **Gray text** serves as either flavor text or as a reminder of how a certain keyword or mechanic works, but has no mechanical meaning itself.
*   **Ability tags** are used to denote the type of any activated abilities on the card (e.g. ↷ or $). Tags are also used by cards that use **levels** to indicate which abilities a card has at a given level.
*   **Dividing lines** are used to make the layout within a card’s text box more clear. Dark gray lines are used to separate different abilities within the text box of a card and to separate abilities from gray text. Lighter gray lines are used to separate the different potential outcomes for an ability involving a dice roll or an ability where the player is given a choice between a number of options. Each choice in such an ability is also indicated with a bullet point.

#### Stat Box

Contains a card’s stats. There are 3 stats: Health, Evasion, and Attack.

The stat box of a character defines the stats of the player that controls it. Character stat boxes only detail a Health and Attack stat; if an ability allows a player to be attacked by another player, it will specify what their evasion is for that attack.

#### Reward Box

Details the rewards of a card. When an object with a reward box dies or is destroyed, the active player gains any rewards detailed in the reward box, unless otherwise specified.

#### Soul Icon

Some cards have a **soul icon**. This indicates the soul value that the card would provide if gained as a soul by a player.

#### Set Symbol

Cards that are not part of the base game have a symbol here that informs you of the card’s origin (i.e. what set it belongs to).


# Bartering

Four Souls is a social game, and players are encouraged to trade ¢ and favors with each other during the game. Any number of ¢ can be traded for almost any favor, but both players involved always have to agree to the deal. Players can’t trade items or loot cards. Bartering doesn’t use the stack.

For example, Player 2 could offer to reroll Player 1’s dice roll, using one of their loot cards, if Player 1 gives them 4¢. The intention behind a proposed trade doesn’t always have to be a noble one, however! For example, as an alternative to the above, Player 2 could threaten to reroll Player 1’s dice roll if Player 1 **doesn’t** give them 4¢, in a situation where Player 1 wouldn’t want to have to reroll.

You don’t need to keep your promises, but be warned**:** if you go back on your word, you will lose the trust of others, and potentially make yourself a target!


# Winning the Game

By default, a player needs to control a soul value of 4 to win. Winning in this way does not use the stack and is checked between things resolving on the stack. Effects can modify the soul value needed to win.

If a player wins, each other player loses. If more than one player wins at the same time, the game is a tie between those players. A player winning or the game ending in a tie ends the game.

An ability may cause a player to win the game. They win after that ability resolves.
