Loot cards are found in the loot deck, and in players’ hands. 

When a player is instructed **to loot**, they draw that many cards from the top of the loot deck into their hand. Players keep loot cards in their hand until they **play** or **discard** them. A player’s hand is private, but anyone can count the number of cards in a player’s hand.

Players can perform a **loot play**, that is to play loot cards from their hand whenever they have priority and a loot play available. 

When loot cards are played they are put onto the stack and referred to as **loot**. When a loot resolves, you perform its loot ability, and then put it into the loot discard.

Some abilities and effects may permit a player to play loot cards from other zones. In these cases normal timing and loot play rules still apply, unless otherwise specified. 

Some other abilities instead allow players to play loot cards as part of resolution. In these cases timing rules do not apply, unless otherwise specified, but loot play rules do still apply. There are also some abilities that will permit a player to play a loot card without using a loot play. This will be specified in the ability if it is the case.
