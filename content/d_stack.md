# The Stack

Each new loot, ability, or dice roll is added to the top of the stack. The stack resolves in a last in, first out order. That means that the last thing put onto the stack will resolve before things put onto the stack before it

A loot or ability resolves when each player passes **priority** in succession from the player who put that loot or ability on the stack, with that player also not putting anything on else the stack themselves.

If an ability is removed from the stack, it does not resolve. If a loot being played is removed from the stack by an ability, it does not resolve and is moved to whatever zone is determined by the ability. If a loot or ability is **canceled,** then it is removed from the stack without resolving. Loot cards removed from the stack in this way go to the loot discard.

# Priority

Priority determines which player can act at any given time. It means that players can potentially respond to events that are occurring in the game, and to each other, even when it is not their turn.

When the rules say that priority passes, priority is first given to the active player, then passed between all other players in turn order. When a player puts a loot, ability, or roll on the stack, priority passes, starting from that player, and then again proceeding in turn order.

While a player has priority, they can take as many (or as few!) actions (e.g. activating an item or playing a loot card) as they want before passing priority to the next player so they have a chance to respond.

When a player has priority, they can activate abilities or play loot cards. In addition, the active player may declare a purchase, declare an attack, or end the turn if they have priority, there is nothing on the stack, and they are in the action phase.

It is only when each player passes priority in succession (i.e. no one wants to do anything else) that the game progresses: whatever is on top of the stack resolves (its effect is carried out), or the game moves to the next step or phase.

Note: There are times when nobody has priority, for example before the Recharge Step at the start of a player’s turn, or after step 1 of the end phase. Players can’t play loot or abilities during these times.

Most of the time it is not necessary to religiously keep track of priority. It is only in more complex situations, for example when multiple players want to respond to the same thing at the same time, that you might need to give it more thought.
