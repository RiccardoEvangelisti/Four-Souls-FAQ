Monster cards are found in the monster deck. Whilst **in play**, monster cards are objects referred to as either a **monster** (if they have a stat block) or an **event** (if they don’t have a stat block).

If an ability on a monster card doesn’t specify a particular player, instead referring to ‘you’, it means the active player.

Abilities on monster cards only function while in play, unless otherwise specified. Abilities on monster cards don’t function while they are a soul, unless otherwise specified. For example, the monster Stoney has a static ability that says “Monsters have +1 DC.” The continuous effect created by that ability would only apply while it is ***in play***. A continuous effect created in this way stays until the card with the static ability leaves its appropriate game zone.

### **Monsters**

Non-event monster cards that have a stat block become **monsters** when in play, and exist in **monster slots**.

**Monsters** can be attacked, unless otherwise specified.

**Boss cards** are a type of non-event monster card that have a soul icon. When a monster with a soul icon dies, the active player gains it as a **soul**, unless otherwise specified.


### **Events**

Event cards are a type of monster card that have no stat block. They become **events** when in play, and also exist in **monster slots**, but they can’t be attacked.

All abilities on event cards, unless otherwise specified, are triggered abilities (see **Abilities**) that trigger **when the card enters play**. If an event card has multiple abilities they will all trigger when the event enters play, unless otherwise specified.

When each of an event’s abilities have resolved or been canceled it is put into the monster discard.

If an event leaves play, its abilities are removed from the stack.


#### Curse cards

**Curse cards** are a type of event card, with the keyword ability **curse** (see **Keyworded Abilities**). The active player chooses which player receives any revealed curses, and they are placed face up near that player’s character. When a player dies, they put all curses they control into discard.


# Attacking
When a monster is killed, it yields a reward, as indicated in the reward box on the card. The **active player** (the player whose turn it is) always receives the rewards when a monster dies, regardless of who actually killed it. The same is true for any souls that may be gained when a **boss** dies.
