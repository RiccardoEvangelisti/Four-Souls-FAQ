Room cards are found in the room deck.

While **in play**, room cards are objects referred to as **rooms**. Rooms exist in **room slots**.

If you are playing with the Room Deck, place the top card of the Room Deck next to it, forming a **room slot**. That card will be the starting **room**.

Rooms can have different types of abilities through which they influence the game. Static and triggered abilities on rooms work just the same as anywhere else. `Activated abilities on rooms can only be activated by the active player`. If a room’s ability doesn’t specify a particular player, for example instead referring to ‘you’, it means the active player.

During the **end phase** (see **Turn Structure**), if a monster died during the turn, the active player can choose to put a room into discard. If that room slot is empty following this, it will be filled with the top card of the room deck.
