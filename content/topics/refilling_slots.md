Refilling Slots
---------------

Each shop slot, monster slot, and room slot (if you are playing with the room deck) must have at least one card in it at all times. Whenever a slot becomes empty, it is refilled with the top card of its respective deck. This normally happens the next time any player would gain priority. When a monster slot has become empty due to a monster dying, the slot will refill after all steps of the monster’s death have taken place and after any triggered abilities that triggered off that monster’s death have resolved (see **Monster Death**).

When refilling a monster slot, it is possible to encounter multiple events in a row. The active player will keep resolving them until a monster ends up in the slot.

The active player will refill any slots and resolve any events that are put into monster slots even if they are dead.

There are a number of abilities that might cause you to expand the number of a certain type of slot during the game. Any new slots added in this way are treated exactly the same as any other, and must also be refilled when empty.
