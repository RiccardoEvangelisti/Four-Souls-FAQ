Setup
-------

Shuffle the Treasure, Loot, and Monster Decks. Also shuffle the Room Deck, if you are playing with it. Set aside space for a discard zone next to each of these decks.

Decide on the number of ¢ in the game’s ¢ pool. This must be at least 100¢.

Place the top two cards of the treasure deck face up next to it, forming two **shop slots**. These are the starting **shop items**.

Place the top two cards of the Monster Deck face up next to it, forming two **monster slots.** Place any event cards (monster cards without a stat block; see **Card Types**) put in these slots during setup on the bottom of the deck and replace them with the top card of the Monster Deck. Repeat this until both monster slots have **monsters** in them.

If you are playing with the Room Deck, place the top card of the Room Deck next to it, forming a **room slot**. That card will be the starting **room**.

If you are playing with **bonus souls**, shuffle them, and pick 3 at random. Those 3 are the **active bonus souls** for the game and are placed face-up next to the play area.

Deal a random character card to each player, as well as that character’s starting item card. Characters start the game **deactivated** (turned sideways). Starting items start the game **charged** (turned upright). Abilities that trigger at the start of the game trigger, for example Eden’s triggered ability. No one has **priority** here (see **The Stack**) and so these abilities will all resolve instantly.

Deal 3 loot cards and 3¢ to each player. Each player puts the loot cards in their **hand**.

Finally, you must decide on the starting player: the saddest player goes first! You can also each roll a dice (lowest roll goes first!) or use any other fair method of randomization, if you prefer. The game then starts, with the starting player taking the first turn.
