Effects
-------

An effect is something that happens due to a loot or ability. When a loot or ability resolves, it may create more effects.

### Continuous Effects

Continuous effects change the characteristics of something, either indefinitely, or until an end point.

Some triggered abilities or activated abilities may create a continuous effect. These last until the end point indicated by the ability. For example, “Items you control gain eternal till end of turn,” creates a continuous effect that lasts until the end of the current turn. If no end point is specified, the continuous effect will last indefinitely.

Some static abilities create a continuous effect. A continuous effect created in this way stays until the card with the static ability leaves its appropriate game zone. For example, the monster Stoney has a static ability that says “Monsters have +1 DC.” The continuous effect created by that ability would only apply while it is in play.

### Replacement Effects

Replacement effects are a special kind of continuous effect. These effects modify how things work. Replacement effects most commonly use the word “instead”. Replacement effects will often also use “if” to indicate the condition(s) that would cause the replacement effect to be applied. Some replacement effects may instead use a timing phrase that would normally indicate a triggered ability, such as “the next time”. In these cases, the use of the word “instead” means that the line functions as a replacement effect with the specified timing, and not as a triggered ability.

Effects that say “prevent” are replacement effects. They replace an indicated event – death or damage – with nothing.

Effects that say “skip” are replacement effects. They replace an indicated event with nothing.

Effects that start with “this enters play” are replacement effects.

Effects that start with “as” are replacement effects.

A replacement effect that starts with “this enters play” or “as” will replace the indicated event with whatever is specified **in addition to** (rather than instead of) the original event itself. For example, if an item with the ability “This enters play deactivated” would enter play, that item entering play as normal is replaced with that item entering play deactivated. If an ability started with ‘As your turn starts, roll-”, the start of your turn would be replaced with the start of your turn **plus** a dice roll.

Replacement effects are not a type of ability in and of themselves, but (like any effect) are rather the result of an ability. For example, the static ability “If you would gain any number of ¢, gain that much +1¢ instead.” creates a replacement effect. This means that replacement effects **do not** use the stack.

Replacement effects only happen once per event. They will not continuously apply to the same event.

If two replacement effects replace the same event, the player affected by the replacement effect (e.g. the active player if it is a part of a turn or phase that is being replaced, the player gaining ¢, loot, or treasure if that is what is being replaced, etc.) gets to choose the order in which they apply. Most of the time, both will still take place. There are some situations where two replacement effects are mutually exclusive. In these situations, whichever one is applied first will change the event to a state where the other replacement effect won’t then be applied.
