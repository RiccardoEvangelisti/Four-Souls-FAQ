# Game Zones

**Game Zones** are areas of the game where cards and objects exist.

If a card moves from one game zone to another at any point `it is considered a new object`. Any abilities that would have targeted it before it moved game zone will fizzle as they would no longer be able to find it. For example, if a monster is covered and leaves play, then is later uncovered, it isn’t considered the same monster from before it was covered.

### In Play

**In play** includes all objects a player controls (such as characters, items, and souls), and `the topmost object in any shop slots, monster slots, or room slots`. In play is a public zone, and all objects within it are considered public information, unless otherwise specified.

### Decks

There are four deck zones: Treasure, Loot, Monster, and Room.

The decks are a hidden zone, and cards in decks are considered hidden information. This means they can’t be viewed unless an effect or ability instructs a player to do so. 

In the unlikely event that a deck ever runs out of cards, you immediately shuffle the appropriate discard pile and make that the new deck.

* * *

### Discard

The game has four discard zones – one that corresponds to each deck.

The discards are a public zone, and as such all cards in discard are considered public information, unless otherwise specified. The number of cards in discard is also public information.

The order of cards in discard can’t be changed unless a player is instructed to do so by an ability.

* * *

### Hand

Each player has their own hand zone. The hand only ever consists of loot cards. A player’s hand is a hidden zone, and cards in a player’s hand are only viewable by that player, unless otherwise specified. The number of cards in a player’s hand is public information, however.

### Covered in a Slot

There are numerous situations that might result in a card in a slot being covered by another card. This most commonly happens with monster slots. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be covered in any one slot. 

Being covered in a slot is considered a different game zone, and importantly cards that are covered in a slot aren’t considered in play.

When an object that is covering a card in a slot leaves play, the card that is under it enters play and is no longer covered in a slot. Ambushes and Trinkets that are covered in a slot become monsters and items again respectively when they enter play from being uncovered.

Covered in a slot is a public zone. That means all cards covered in a slot are considered public information, unless otherwise specified. The order of cards in a slot can’t be changed unless a player is instructed to do so by an ability.

### The Stack

*The stack* is a zone where loot, abilities, dice rolls, and other things go to resolve.

### Outside the Game

*Outside the game* is a zone that consists of cards that aren’t in any of the previously listed zones.

The **active bonus souls** that have been chosen for the game start outside the game, as does the card “The Harbingers” from the Requiem expansion. Character cards, starting item cards, and bonus souls that aren’t being used also exist outside the game.

Unless otherwise specified, cards that are outside the game don’t have abilities. The three active bonus souls are an exception to this, and their abilities are active while they are outside the game.

If a player is instructed to put an object or card under an object not in a slot, it is considered outside the game. For example, Friendly Ball’s ability puts monsters under it. The cards that are under it are outside the game.

Cards that are outside the game are considered public information, unless otherwise specified. Face-down cards outside the game are considered hidden information. Effects and abilities may give you permission to look at these cards, however.
