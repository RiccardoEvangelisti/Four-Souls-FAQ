Winning the Game
----------------

By default, a player needs to control a soul value of 4 to win. Winning in this way does not use the stack and is checked between things resolving on the stack. Effects can modify the soul value needed to win.

If a player wins, each other player loses. If more than one player wins at the same time, the game is a tie between those players. A player winning or the game ending in a tie ends the game.

An ability may cause a player to win the game. They win after that ability resolves.
