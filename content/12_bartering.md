# Bartering

Four Souls is a social game, and players are encouraged to trade ¢ and favors with each other during the game. Any number of ¢ can be traded for almost any favor, but both players involved always have to agree to the deal. Players can’t trade items or loot cards. Bartering doesn’t use the stack.

For example, Player 2 could offer to reroll Player 1’s dice roll, using one of their loot cards, if Player 1 gives them 4¢. The intention behind a proposed trade doesn’t always have to be a noble one, however! For example, as an alternative to the above, Player 2 could threaten to reroll Player 1’s dice roll if Player 1 **doesn’t** give them 4¢, in a situation where Player 1 wouldn’t want to have to reroll.

You don’t need to keep your promises, but be warned**:** if you go back on your word, you will lose the trust of others, and potentially make yourself a target!
