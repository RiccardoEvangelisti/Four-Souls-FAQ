# Souls

When a player controls a card with a soul icon as a **soul**, it provides them with a soul value. Even if a **soul** has a soul value greater than 1 it is still considered a single object. This means a soul with a soul value of 2 can be destroyed or stolen, for example, just the same as any other soul with a soul value of 1. There are, however, a number of abilities in the game that look for the number of souls a player controls. These abilities refer to the **total soul value** a player controls. Similarly, if an ability looks for a player gaining or being given a soul, it will consider a soul with a soul value of greater than 1 the same as gaining or being given a number of souls equal to that soul value, even though technically just one soul is coming under that player’s control.

Players keep any souls they control face up next to their character to keep track of them. The number of souls a player controls is public information.

### Bonus Souls

When starting a game where you are playing with bonus souls, you shuffle them and pick 3 at random. Those 3 are the **active bonus souls** for the game. These cards are not added to any deck and are instead put face up next to the play area. Bonus souls, before they are gained, are not considered in play.

Once the conditions of a bonus soul are met it is gained and becomes a **soul**. This happens as soon as the conditions are met. From this point, it will act like any other soul under the control of a player. Abilities on bonus souls don’t function once they have been gained as a **soul**, unless otherwise specified.

Bonus souls can only be gained once per game. If a bonus soul is ever destroyed, they are placed face down next to the game and cannot be gained again.
